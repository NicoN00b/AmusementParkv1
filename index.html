<!--Safety first!

Create a website for an amusement park that prompts the user to enter their height.
The page should then only displays information about rides the user is tall enough to safely ride.
Then, try showing a list of all rides and just highlighting (with CSS) the ones the user may safely ride.
(Make sure there are some rides that an adult can't go on because they are too tall!)-->
